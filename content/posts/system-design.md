### Scaling

- NoSQL for:
  - low latency
  - unstructured or non relational data
  - only need to serialize and deserialize (json, xml, yaml, etc)
  - store massive amount of data
  - consistency is not a big deal, consistent scaling.
- Cache:
  - read frequenly, modified infrequently
  - implement expiration policy
  - consistency is hard for multiple regions
  - eviction policy: LRU, LFU, FIFO
- CDN:
  - Dynamic content caching??
  - Cache static content near the user
  - The origin returns TTL to describe how long to cache.
- Move session data out of web servers and into a cache / NoSQL.
- Message queue for async tasks, pub/sub.
- Sharding: choose a good sharding key / partition key
  - reshard when a single shard is not enough, have exhausted shards due to uneven distribution.
  - beware of celebrity problem, what if Justin Bieber and Lady gaga are in the same shard.
  - joins are hard in sharded databases, try denormalizing.

### Back of the envelope estimation

Notes
-----
1 ns = 10^-9 seconds
1 us = 10^-6 seconds = 1,000 ns
1 ms = 10^-3 seconds = 1,000 us = 1,000,000 ns

## [The Twelve-Factor App](https://12factor.net/)

1. **Codebase**: Use VCS (git), one codebase per app. Refactor shared code into libraries.
2. **Dependencies**: Declare and isolate dependencies, vendor if necessary.
3. **Config**: Use environment variables, do not group them together.
4. **Backing services**: Treat them (MySQL, RabbitMQ) as attached resources via config.
5. **Build, release, run**: Strict separation between these stages, releases cannot be mutated and are append-only.
6. **Processes**: Processes are stateless and share-nothing. Implement sticky sessions using Memcached or Redis.
7. **Port binding**: Export services via port binding.
8. **Concurrency**: Scale out via the process model horizontally.
9. **Disposability**: Fast startup and graceful shutdown using disposable processes.
10. **Dev/prod parity**: Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible, continuous deployment.
11. **Logs**: Print unbuffered to stdout and should be captured by the executing environment.
12. **Admin processes**: Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes.

## [Scalability for Dummies](https://www.lecloud.net/tagged/scalability)

- Hide servers behing a load balancer.
- Servers does not store any user related data, store sessions in an external cache.
- Denormalize and use NoSQL + cache
- Try to retrieve data from cache and use database on miss.
- Cache objects (sessions, articles, activity streams, user relations) instead of queries.
- Async
  - Precomputing (pre-render static html for CDN)
  - Job queues
