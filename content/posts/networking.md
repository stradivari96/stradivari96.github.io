## OSI Model

![OSI](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230417045622/OSI-vs-TCP-vs-Hybrid-2.webp)

### 7. Application Layer

> Data generated by and usable by software applications (eg: API calls).

Protocols: [**HTTP**](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/hypertext-transfer-protocol-http/) and [**SMTP**](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/email-security/what-is-smtp/).

### 6. Presentation Layer

> Responsible for translation, encryption, and compression of data.

Protocols: HTTPS??

### 5. Session Layer

> This is the layer responsible for opening and closing communication between the two devices.

Usually handled by TCP.

### 4. Transport Layer

> This includes taking data from the session layer and breaking it up into chunks called segments before sending it to layer 3.

Protocols: [TCP](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/tcp-ip/), [UDP](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/user-datagram-protocol-udp/).

### 3. Network Layer

> Handles the routing and sending of data between different networks.

Protocols: [IP](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/internet-protocol/) and [ICMP](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/internet-control-message-protocol-icmp/).

#### Router (Gateway)

Device that forwards packets to a destination other than the local network

### 2. Data Link Layer

> Facilitates data transfer between two devices on the same network.

#### Ethernet Switches

Forwarding based on MAC addresses, maintains a mapping of MAC -> PORT (physical).

#### Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_Resolution_Protocol#Example

### 1. Physical Layer

> Includes the physical equipment involved in the data transfe (cables and switches). Data gets converted into a bit stream (1s and 0s).
