Some notes about climbing

## General

- Warm up / Have a plan
- Focus on foolholds instead of handholds (legs first)
- Do not skip footholds!
- Foot into the wall for balance if no holds (practice only one foot on a hold + remove one hand before moving)
- Straight arms
- Hips / center of gravity close to the wall
- Think about how to hold the handholds (direction, grip)

## Bouldering

- If cant get on, start away from the wall and add momentum
- Stand at the edge of the foothold, to lift the other foot easier

## Supplemental training / Injury prevention

- Pull ups / push ups / squats
- Flexibility training
- Leave finger strength training for later
