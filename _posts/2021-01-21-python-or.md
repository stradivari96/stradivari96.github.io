Some useful (and maintained) libraries for doing Operations Research in Python.

## [Google OR-Tools](https://developers.google.com/optimization)

> OR-Tools is an open source software suite for optimization, tuned for tackling the world's toughest problems in vehicle routing, flows, integer and linear programming, and constraint programming.

- Routing library on top of CP.
- CP-SAT Solver (Lazy Clause Generation combining SAT, CP, MIP and LNS)
- GLOP (simplex solver)
- BOP (boolean linear solver)
- Interface for third party solvers: CoinOR, SCIP, CPLEX, Gurobi, XPress

## [CVXPY](https://www.cvxpy.org/)

> CVXPY is a Python-embedded modeling language for convex optimization problems.

## [Pyomo](http://www.pyomo.org/)

> Pyomo is a Python-based, open-source optimization modeling language.

## [PuLP](https://coin-or.github.io/pulp/)

> PuLP is an LP modeler written in Python. PuLP can generate MPS or LP files and call GLPK, COIN-OR CLP/CBC, CPLEX, GUROBI, MOSEK, XPRESS, CHOCO, MIPCL, SCIP to solve linear problems.

## [DEAP](https://deap.readthedocs.io/en/master/)

> DEAP is a novel evolutionary computation framework for rapid prototyping and testing of ideas.

## [PySwarms](https://pyswarms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

> PySwarms is an extensible research toolkit for particle swarm optimization (PSO) in Python.

## [skopt](https://scikit-optimize.github.io/stable/)

> Simple and efficient library to minimize (very) expensive and noisy black-box functions. It implements several methods for sequential model-based optimization.

## [BayesianOptimization](https://github.com/fmfn/BayesianOptimization)

> Pure Python implementation of bayesian global optimization with gaussian processes.
