Some useful (and maintained) libraries for doing Operations Research in Python.

## [Google OR-Tools](https://developers.google.com/optimization)

[![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/google/or-tools.svg?style=social)](https://github.com/google/or-tools)
[![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/pypi/dw/ortools)](https://pypi.org/project/ortools/)

> OR-Tools is an open source software suite for optimization, tuned for tackling the world's toughest problems in vehicle routing, flows, integer and linear programming, and constraint programming.

- Routing library on top of CP.
- CP-SAT Solver (Lazy Clause Generation combining SAT, CP, MIP and LNS)
- GLOP (simplex solver)
- BOP (boolean linear solver)
- Interface for third party solvers: CoinOR, SCIP, CPLEX, Gurobi, XPress
