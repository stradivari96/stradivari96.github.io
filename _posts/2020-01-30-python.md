## Virtual environments
If you are working on multiple projects, you may find yourself with conflicts between the installed packages and the ones you need to use for another project. Sometimes you may even have to use different versions of Python.

Python virtual environments allow you to isolate the packages and binaries that each project needs, avoiding these kind of problems.

### [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)

> Poetry helps you declare, manage and install dependencies of Python projects, ensuring you have the right stack everywhere.

### [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)

Used with `pip` and `requirements.txt`. You can also use [virualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/) to make things easier.

[venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) is very similar and is shipped in the standard library.

### [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)

Heavy package and environment manager, only recommended for the data science/scientific community.

### [Pipenv](https://pipenv.kennethreitz.org/en/latest/)

Recommended by [The Python Packaging Guide](https://packaging.python.org/guides/tool-recommendations/#application-dependency-management), combines Pipfile, pip and virtualenv into a single tool.

## PyCharm

[PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) is a very powerful IDE for Python, it comes with:

- A default [PEP-8 linter](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
- Code completion and error checking.
- Easy documentation browser.
- Virtual Environments manager.
- Integrated terminal and version control utilities.

## Linters / Code formatters

- A **linter**, is a tool that analyzes source code to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and suspicious constructs.
- A code **formatter** changes your code according to set standards in order to make it easily navigable and readable.

A linter is a must have in any programming project, it makes your code more consistent, easier to read and to maintain.

I highly recommend using an automatic code formatter, it saves you time and energy to get things done
instead of worrying about code style or fixing the linting errors.

- [autopep8](https://github.com/hhatto/autopep8): oldest tool of this list, makes your code conform to the [PEP-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide.
- [yapf](https://github.com/google/yapf): maintained by Google and very configurable.
- [black](https://github.com/psf/black): opinionated formatter created by a Python Core Developer, keeps discussions to a minimum by deciding everything for you.

## Type Hints

Python is a dynamically typed language, but that doesn't mean you can't have **type checking** and **autocompletion** with a good IDE and some type hinting.

```python
def string_to_number(string: str) -> int:
    # do something
    return number
```

In this example PyCharm will show a **warning** if we pass something to our function that is not a string and it will also show us all the methods available from the string class when dealing with the **string** parameter.

## Coding tips

Here are some useful tips for writing cleaner code:

### f-strings

Introduced on Python 3.6, it is a great way to format strings.
Just put `f` before the quotes of your string and put your variables between brackets.

```python
x, y, z = 1.0, 2.0, 3.0
# f-strings
print(f'The coordinates are: {x}, {y}, {z}')

# Old way
print('The coordinates are: %s, %s, %s' % (x, y, z))

# .format()
print('The coordinates are: {}, {}, {}'.format(x, y, z))
print('The coordinates are: {0}, {1}, {2}'.format(x, y, z))
print('The coordinates are: {x}, {y}, {z}'.format(x=x, y=y, z=z))
```

### Built-in Functions

[Built-in](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html) functions are there for a reason, you may already know the most common ones:

- dict, int, float, len, list, print, range, set, str, sum, tuple

So let's learn about some others:

- **enumerate()**: Allows looping over something and having an automatic counter.

```python
my_list = ['a', 'b', 'c', 1, 2]
# Write
for idx, value in enumerate(my_list):
    print(f'Index: {idx}, Value: {value}')

# Instead of
for idx in range(len(my_list)):
    print(f'Index: {idx}, Value: {my_list[idx]}')
```

- **reversed()**: Iterate in reverse order.

```python
for i in reversed([1,2,3,4]):
    print(i)
# 4, 3, 2, 1
```

- **min()** and **max()**: Get the minimum and maximum items in an iterable.

```python
min([1, 2, 3]) # 1
min([1, 2, 3], key=lambda x: x%3) # 3 (3 mod 3 == 0)

max([1, 2, 3]) # 3
max([1, 2, 3], key=lambda x: x%3) # 2 (2 mod 3 == 2)
```

- **sorted()**: Returns a new sorted list.

```python
sorted([4, 2, 1, 3]) # [1, 2, 3 ,4]
sorted([4, 2, 1, 3], reverse=True) # [4, 3, 2, 1]

sorted(["Hello", "my", "name", "is", "Xiang"])  # ['Hello', 'Xiang', 'is', 'my', 'name']
sorted(["Hello", "my", "name", "is", "Xiang"], key=len)  # ['is', 'my', 'name', 'Hello', 'Xiang']
```

- **any()** and **all()**: Check if any or all items match a condition.

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
any(n%2 == 0 for n in numbers)  # True
all(n%2 == 0 for n in numbers)  # False

even = [2, 4, 6, 8]
all(n%2 == 0 for n in even)  # True
any(n%2 == 1 for n in even)  # False
```

### [collections](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html)

A standard library module that provides some interesting datatypes.

- **namedtuple()**: quick way to create tuples with fields.

```python
from collections import namedtuple

Point = namedtuple('Point', ['x', 'y'])
p = Point(11, y=22)
p # Point(x=11, y=22)

p[0]  # 11
p.x   # 11

x, y = p
x, y  # (11, 22)
```

- **Counter**: dict subclass for counting hashable objects.

```python
from collections import Counter

c = Counter(["a", "b", "b", "c", "d", "d", "d"])
# Counter({'d': 3, 'b': 2, 'a': 1, 'c': 1})
```

- **defaultdict**: dict subclass that returns a default value if a key is missing.

```python
from collections import defaultdict

d = defaultdict(list)
for w in ["Paris", "Barcelona", "London", "Lisbon", "Bogotá"]:
    first_letter = w[0]
    d[first_letter].append(w)  # does not raise any errors

# defaultdict(<class 'list'>, {
#   'P': ['Paris'],
#   'B': ['Barcelona', 'Bogotá'],
#   'L': ['London', 'Lisbon']
# })
```

### Sets

> A set is an unordered collection with no duplicate elements.

Consider using sets when:

```python
# Need unique values
set([1,2,3,1,1,5,2]) # {1, 2, 3, 5}

# Are doing something like this where order doesn't matter
my_list = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
for i in range(10):
    if i not in my_list:
        my_list.append(i)

# Using sets
my_set = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}
for i in range(10):
    my_set.add(i)  # won't duplicate

# Need fast lookup on large amounts of data
3 in my_set  # O(1)
3 in my_list # O(n)
```

### argparse

Instead of using `input()` to ask for parameters for you script, consider using command-line options.

```python
import argparse

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
parser.add_argument("-i", "--input", type=str, help="input file")
parser.add_argument("-o", "--output", type=str, default="output.txt")
args = parser.parse_args()

print(f'I will process {args.input} and write into {args.output}')
# $ python script.py -i input.txt -o output.o
#> I will process input.txt and write into output.o

# $ python script.py -i test
#> I will process test and write into output.txt
```

### List Comprehensions

If you use them correctly, they can be more readable than loops, `filter` or `map`.

```python
even_numbers = [i for i in range(10) if i % 2 == 0]
# [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]

odd_numbers = [i for i in range(10) if i not in even_numbers]
# [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]

squares = [i**2 for i in range(10)]
# [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
```

Careful though:

```python
# Not very readable
flat = [x for sublist1 in my_lists
        for sublist2 in sublist1
        for x in sublist2]

# Indentation helps
flat = []
for sublist1 in my_lists:
    for sublist2 in sublist1:
        flat.extend(sublist2)
```

### Other Comprehensions

Don't forget there are all also _set_ and _dictionary_ comprehensions.

```python
# Set comprehensions
names = ['BoB', 'bob', 'BOB', 'Alice', 'Jordan', 'JORDan']
names_set = {name.lower() for name in names}
# {'jordan', 'alice', 'bob'}

# Dictionary comprehensions
characters = {name: len(name) for name in names}
# {'BoB': 3, 'bob': 3, 'BOB': 3, 'Alice': 5, 'Jordan': 6, 'JORDan': 6}
```

### Keyword Arguments

Using keyword arguments may make your code a lot more readable.

```python
def loan_money(amount, interest, lender, borrower):
    pass

loan_money(300, 0.2, 'Bob', 'Alice')
# What does the 0.2 mean? Who is the lender?

loan_money(300, interest=0.2, lender='Bob', borrower='Alice')
```

You can even **force** some arguments to be keyword only!

```python
# The * symbol indicates the beginning of keyword-only arguments
def loan_money(amount, interest=0.1, *, lender, borrower):
    pass

loan_money(300, 0.2, 'Bob', 'Alice')
# TypeError: loan_money() takes from 1 to 2 positional arguments but 4 were given

loan_money(300, lender='Bob', borrower='Alice')
# OK, interest will be 0.1 (default value)
```
