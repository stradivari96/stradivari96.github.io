I really enjoy well crafted Anime Music Videos, in this post I will review some of my favourites.

If you just want to see the videos, here is my [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9Y_WvjnkQLKAzwABQHVn64i1QEBXvupM).

## *The Boy Who Murdered Love* by [ONEWAYS](https://www.youtube.com/user/onewaysAMV)
A very nice AMV combining characters from [Hyouka](https://myanimelist.net/anime/12189/Hyouka), one of my favourites animes, with *Minori* from [Toradora!](https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora), another anime well received by the community.

The edit is ***amazing*** and you won't even notice that some characters come from another series.

**Fun fact**: This AMV has almost ten times more views than the original [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bibg3HLaeag).

## *The Girl Who Caught Love* by [ONEWAYS](https://www.youtube.com/user/onewaysAMV)
Another **amazing** AMV from *ONEWAYS*. It is incredible how they always insert characters from another series like they just belong there.

The animes used are: [Your Lie in April](https://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso) and [Nozaki-kun](https://myanimelist.net/anime/23289/Gekkan_Shoujo_Nozaki-kun).

## *That girl!* by [DiabyX](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr7WfXquNbJnmGEubv8Ro8A)
A well edited AMV of [Nisekoi](https://myanimelist.net/anime/18897/Nisekoi). It ships **best girl** with the protagonist using different scenes and makes a very good usage of the song's lyrics and typography.

## *Singular Strike Gentleman* by [Glitzer](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdwEBR8A-XR-14ova7xskWQ)
A simple yet fun AMV of [One Punch Man](https://myanimelist.net/anime/30276/One_Punch_Man). The **follow the lyrics** approach works quite well with this song and anime.

## *Let's play Ball* by [IDÂêõ](https://space.bilibili.com/143322)
I have to give props to the editor just for the **sheer amount** of animes used in this AMV. The transitions are also quite smooth and the video is overall quite well edited.
