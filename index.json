default, OR-tools will try to use all available cores but you can set num_search_workers manually.\nsolver.parameters.num_search_workers = 8 If the program silently crashes you can enable logging to get more info.\nsolver.parameters.log_search_progress = True You can also see which worker is better for your problem and improve the single core performance by setting the same parameters.\nSearch for all optimal solutions You can\u0026rsquo;t enumerate all solutions if you have an objective, so you have to do it in two steps:\n# Get the optimal objective value model.Maximize(objective) solver.Solve(model) # Set the objective to a fixed value # use round() instead of int() model.Add(objective == round(solver.ObjectiveValue())) model.Proto().ClearField(\u0026#39;objective\u0026#39;) #

Modeled around a business domain (end-to-end slices of business functionality). Implementation details are hidden (owning their own state, no sharing of databases, different technologies/try new things, etc). Tip\nThey allow developers to work independently, reducing delivery contention. (Technology Heterogeneity, Robustness, Scaling, Ease of Deployment, Organizational Alignment, Composability, etc)\nInfo\nThey are not a great idea if the product is brand new or the domain is undergoing significant change. Also, if the team is small, the time spent on deployment and management might not be worth it. (Developer Experience, Deployment Overhead, Cost, Reporting, Monitoring, Security, Testing, Latency, Data Consistency, etc)\nMonoliths A valid default choice, doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean legacy.\nSingle-process monoliths: most common, single process that talks to a database (monolithic Django, Rails, etc). Modular monoliths: single process with separate modules that can be worked on independently (shopify). Distributed monolith: multiple services that must be deployed together (disadvages of distributed systems and single-process monoliths, not enough focus on information hiding and cohesion of business functionality). Microservice Boundary Information Hiding: improve development time by allowing more things to be worked on in parallel, allow each module to be understood in isolation and allow modules to be changed independently. The important thing is to form good boundaries between modules. Cohesion The code that changes together, stays together.\nWe want the functionality grouped in a way that we have to make changes in as few places as possible. Avoiding the need to deploy multiple services at the same time.\nCoupling A structure is stable if cohesion is strong and coupling is low.\nSome coupling is inevitable, but we want to minimize it. A loosely coupled service knows as little as it needs to about the other services. Limiting the number of different types of calls is also important, chatty communication is a sign of tight coupling.\nDomain Coupling: Largely unavoidable, occurs when one microservice needs a functionality that the other provides. If a microservice needs to talk to a lot of other microservices it might be doing too much. Also, remember to send only the absolute minimum amount of data needed. Temporal Coupling: One microservice needs another to do something at the same time (synchronous HTTP call), it isn\u0026rsquo;t inherently bad, but with more microservices it can cause issues if you want to scale. Pass-Through Coupling: one microservice passes data to another microservice because it is needed by some other downstream microservice. There are some ways to improve this: bypass the intermediary, make the intermediary take in data in its contract and delegate the formatting to it or make the intermediary treat the needed data as an opaque blob. Common Coupling: two o more microservices use a common set of data (shared database, shared memory or filesystem), changing the structure of the data can impact multiple services. This can be a big problem if the structure of the common data changes frequently / multiple microservices are reading and writing. Who should be responsible of managing the correct lifecycle of the data, do we make a thin CRUD wrapper and reduce cohesion? Content Coupling: similar to common coupling but there is no clear knowledge about ownership of the data (eg: one microserve makes changes to a database bypassing the actual service that exposes the data). DDD Important concepts for building microservices:\nUbiquitous Language: the same language is used by all the stakeholders (developers, business, etc). Aggregates: a group of objects that are treated as a unit for the purpose of data changes, typically have a life cycle around them / state machine. Bounded Context: organizational boundary, internal concerns should be hidden, make use of hidden models and shared models of associated aggregates. Mapping Aggregates and Bounded Contexts to Microservices: you can always star with a coarser-grained API and split into more microservices if needed (implementation detail). Event Storming: a technique for building a domain model with both technical and nontechnical stakeholders. Alternatives:\nVolatility: extract parts that go through a lot of changes (eg: bimodal IT, Mode 1 and Mode 2), not very recommended. Data: driven by privacy and security concerns, to reduce risk of data breaches and simplify oversight. Technology: this isn\u0026rsquo;t really a general means of decomposition. Organizational: driven by the organizational structure of the company, prefer end-to-end vertical slice instead of a horizontal slice. Splitting the Monolith Microservices are not the goal just a means to an end. Incremental migration, identify quick wins, avoid premature decomposition. Balance difficulty with benefits. Patterns: Strangler Fig: wrap an old system with the new system gradually. Parallel Run: run both and compare. Feature Toggle: feature flags. Data Decomposition: Performance: joins? Integrity: cascading? Transactions: distributed transactions, sagas? Reporting database for external reading.

Leave .commit() as a responsibility for the caller. For simple cases this abstraction is unnecessary, you can just stick with ORMs. Create an in-memory FakeRepository for testing. Info\nSome people consider \u0026ldquo;monkeypatching\u0026rdquo; a code smell and prefer using Fakes.\nService Pass the repository as a parameter to service-layer functions and use primitives instead of Domain objects. Leave endpoints as a thin wrapper for parsing and returning HTTP responses, but you can combine controller/views if it is just a web app. Write tests for the service layer. Unit of Work Use context manager and initialize the repository on __enter__. Explicit commit is recommended for easier state flushing. Add uow to the service layer. Aggregates and Consistency Boundaries An AGGREGATE is a cluster of associated objects that we treat as a unit for the purpose of data changes.\nConfigure version counters for Optimistic Concurrency Control. Retry on conflict. The only repository that should be used is the one for the aggregate. Part 1: https://github.com/cosmicpython/code/tree/chapter_07_aggregate\nEvents and Message Bus To avoid violating the single responsibility principle, use events instead of commands. A message bus is a dict that maps event types to a list of handlers. Rethink API calls as capturing events. Services will have only 2 params: the event and the uow. Commands If at first you don’t succeed, retry the operation with an exponentially increasing back-off period.\nCommands are usually imperative verbs and expect a response. Events are usually past-tense verbs and broadcasted. Event-Driven Architecture Use an external message broker (redis, kafka, rabbitmq). Two services should accept eventual consistency between them. Avoid the Distributed Big Ball of Mud, think in terms of verbs / business processes with asynchronous communication. https://martinfowler.com/articles/201701-event-driven.html\nCommand-Query Responsibility Separation (CQRS) Create thin views for our data: via raw SQL??

This reduces the dependencies between communicating objects, thereby reducing coupling.\nMemento Pattern Provides the ability to restore an object to its previous state.\nVisitor Pattern Separates an algorithm from an object structure on which it operates.\nStructural Decorator Pattern The Decorator pattern is used to dynamically add a new feature to an object without changing its implementation. It differs from inheritance because the new feature is added only to that particular object, not to the entire subclass.\nClasses should be open for extension, but closed for modification. class TextTag: def __init__(self, text: str) -\u0026gt; None: self._text = text def render(self) -\u0026gt; str: return self._text class BoldWrapper(TextTag): def __init__(self, wrapped: TextTag) -\u0026gt; None: self._wrapped = wrapped def render(self) -\u0026gt; str: return f\u0026#34;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;{self._wrapped.render()}\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026#34; class ItalicWrapper(TextTag): def __init__(self, wrapped: TextTag) -\u0026gt; None: self._wrapped = wrapped def render(self) -\u0026gt; str: return f\u0026#34;\u0026lt;i\u0026gt;{self._wrapped.render()}\u0026lt;/i\u0026gt;\u0026#34; Adapter Pattern The Adapter pattern provides a different interface for a class. We can think about it as a cable adapter that allows you to charge a phone somewhere that has outlets in a different shape. Following this idea, the Adapter pattern is useful to integrate classes that couldn\u0026rsquo;t be integrated due to their incompatible interfaces.\nclass Adapter: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;Adapts an object by replacing methods.

The intent of a composite is to \u0026ldquo;compose\u0026rdquo; objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Implementing the composite pattern lets clients treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.\nclass Graphic(ABC): @abstractmethod def render(self) -\u0026gt; None: raise NotImplementedError(\u0026#34;You should implement this!\u0026#34;) class CompositeGraphic(Graphic): def __init__(self) -\u0026gt; None: self.graphics: List[Graphic] = [] def render(self) -\u0026gt; None: for graphic in self.graphics: graphic.render() def add(self, graphic: Graphic) -\u0026gt; None: self.graphics.append(graphic) def remove(self, graphic: Graphic) -\u0026gt; None: self.graphics.remove(graphic) class Ellipse(Graphic): def __init__(self, name: str) -\u0026gt; None: self.name = name def render(self) -\u0026gt; None: print(f\u0026#34;Ellipse: {self.name}\u0026#34;) ellipse1 = Ellipse(\u0026#34;1\u0026#34;) ellipse2 = Ellipse(\u0026#34;2\u0026#34;) graphic1 = CompositeGraphic() graphic2 = CompositeGraphic() graphic1.add(ellipse1) graphic1.add(ellipse2) # Here graphic = CompositeGraphic() graphic.add(graphic1) graphic.add(graphic2) graphic.render() Proxy Pattern Proxy is used in places where you want to add functionality to a class without changing its interface. The main class is called Real Subject. A client should use the proxy or the real subject without any code change, so both must have the same interface. Logging and controlling access to the real subject are some of the proxy pattern usages.\nclass Subject: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; As mentioned in the document, interfaces of both RealSubject and Proxy should be the same, because the client should be able to use RealSubject or Proxy with no code change. Not all times this interface is necessary. The point is the client should be able to use RealSubject or Proxy interchangeably with no change in code. \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; def do_the_job(self, user: str) -\u0026gt; None: raise NotImplementedError() class RealSubject(Subject): \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; This is the main job doer.

A Flyweight is an object shared by multiple contexts, and is indistinguishable from an object that is not shared.\nCreational Factory Pattern A Factory is an object for creating other objects.\nDepend upon abstractions. Do not depend upon concrete classes. class GreekLocalizer: def __init__(self) -\u0026gt; None: self.translations = {\u0026#34;dog\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;σκύλος\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;cat\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;γάτα\u0026#34;} def localize(self, msg: str) -\u0026gt; str: return self.translations.get(msg, msg) class EnglishLocalizer: def localize(self, msg: str) -\u0026gt; str: return msg def get_localizer(language: str = \u0026#34;English\u0026#34;) -\u0026gt; object: localizers = { \u0026#34;English\u0026#34;: EnglishLocalizer, \u0026#34;Greek\u0026#34;: GreekLocalizer, } return localizers[language]() Abstract Factory Pattern In Java and other languages, the Abstract Factory Pattern serves to provide an interface for creating related/dependent objects without need to specify their actual class.\nclass PetShop: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;A pet shop\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; def __init__(self, animal_factory: Type[Pet]) -\u0026gt; None: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;pet_factory is our abstract factory.

Just declare a variable there.\nBuilder Pattern It decouples the creation of a complex object and its representation, so that the same process can be reused to build objects from the same family. This is useful when you must separate the specification of an object from its actual representation (generally for abstraction).\nPrototype Pattern This patterns aims to reduce the number of classes required by an application. Instead of relying on subclasses it creates objects by copying a prototypical instance at run-time.\n","permalink":"https://xiang.es/posts/patterns/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eSome notes about design patterns\u003c/p\u003e","title":"📝 Design Patterns notes"},{"content":"Overview of the CP-SAT solver from Google OR-Tools\nReferences: Laurent Perron and Frédéric Didier, CPAIOR 2020: https://youtu.be/lmy1ddn4cyw Peter J. Stuckey, Search is Dead: https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/pstuckey/PPDP2013.pdf Model Building The first step is building the model using the CPModel class. This class is actually a wrapper around the cp_model protobuf.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s see an example (source):\nfrom ortools.sat.python import cp_model \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;Minimal CP-SAT example to showcase calling the solver.\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; # Creates the model. # [START model] model = cp_model.CpModel() # [END model] # Creates the variables. # [START variables] num_vals = 3 x = model.NewIntVar(0, num_vals - 1, \u0026#39;x\u0026#39;) y = model.NewIntVar(0, num_vals - 1, \u0026#39;y\u0026#39;) z = model.NewIntVar(0, num_vals - 1, \u0026#39;z\u0026#39;) # [END variables] # Creates the constraints. # [START constraints] model.Add(x != y) # [END constraints] # Creates a solver and solves the model. # [START solve] solver = cp_model.CpSolver() status = solver.Solve(model) # [END solve] if status == cp_model.FEASIBLE: print(\u0026#39;x = %i\u0026#39; % solver.Value(x)) print(\u0026#39;y = %i\u0026#39; % solver.Value(y)) print(\u0026#39;z = %i\u0026#39; % solver.Value(z)) This model creates the following proto print(str(model)):\nvariables { name: \u0026#34;x\u0026#34; domain: 0 domain: 2 } variables { name: \u0026#34;y\u0026#34; domain: 0 domain: 2 } variables { name: \u0026#34;z\u0026#34; domain: 0 domain: 2 } constraints { linear { vars: 1 vars: 0 coeffs: -1 coeffs: 1 domain: -9223372036854775808 domain: -1 domain: 1 domain: 9223372036854775807 } } Note: int64 is [-9223372036854775808, 9223372036854775807]\nPresolve Loop First stage: We will process all active constraints until a fix point is reached. During this stage:\nVariable will never be deleted, but their domain will be reduced. Constraint will never be deleted (they will be marked as empty if needed). New variables and new constraints can be added after the existing ones. Constraints are added only when needed to the mapping_problem if they are needed during the postsolve. Second stage:\nAll the variables domain will be copied to the mapping_model. Everything will be remapped so that only the variables appearing in some constraints will be kept and their index will be in [0, num_new_variables). - source Presolve: Domain reduction, constraint simplification/rewrite Constraint expansion/decomposition: Similar to Minizinc -\u0026gt; Flatzinc (element constraint, table, automaton, inverse, product, modulo, reservoir) Detect variable equivalence and affine relations. Substitute by canonical representation. Probing: Fix variables and see what is propagated. This produces 2 new models, the inner model that will be solved and a channeling model used to populate the solution of the initial model. - source\nSolver The CP-SAT solver uses a lazy clause generation solver on top of an SAT solver. The best description is a presentation from Peter Stuckey called Search is Dead - Laurent Perron\nIn Lazy clause generation (LCG), integer variables are encoded as booleans, ortools creates 2 booleans for each variable and value:\nvar == value var \u0026lt;= value Note: var \u0026gt;= value (represented as ![x \u0026lt;= value-1])\n(var == value) \u0026lt;=\u0026gt; (var \u0026gt;= value) and (var \u0026lt;= value) (var \u0026lt;= value) =\u0026gt; (var \u0026lt;= value+1) Propagation is clause generation:\ne.g. [x \u0026lt;= 2] and x \u0026gt;= y means that [y \u0026lt;= 2] clause [x \u0026lt;= 2] =\u0026gt; [y \u0026lt;= 2] Linear relaxation TODO\nDefault search (single thread) VSIDS on the Boolean problem, when it reaches a fixed point, it asks the heuristic to select an integer variable, a value and a braching direction.\nMultithreading The solver uses the first X threads to generic methods, and use all the remaining ones on LNS (Large Neighborhood Search). -Laurent Perron\n","permalink":"https://xiang.es/posts/explaining-cp-sat/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eOverview of the CP-SAT solver from Google OR-Tools\u003c/p\u003e","title":"🎓 How the CP-SAT solver works"},{"content":"How I set up this website using GitHub Pages, namecheap and Cloudflare\nInfo\nI have migrated my website to Hugo PaperMod.\nRead the Papermod Guide and how to host on Github for more info.\nGitHub Pages GitHub Pages is a free and easy way to host a static website.
